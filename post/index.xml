      <description>Algorithms used Tf-idf vectorizer : The term tf–idf stands for term frequency–inverse document frequency. It is a mathematical statistic that is planned to reflect how significant a word is to a record in a collection or corpus. The tf–idf esteem builds proportionally to the number of times a word shows up in the document. It is offset by the quantity of documents in the corpus that contain the word, which helps to adjust for the fact that a few words show up more often when all is said and done.</description>
